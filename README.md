# Access-Code-Cracking Game/Simulation

This JavaScript game generates a random 10-digit access code and allows users to simulate cracking it through a drag-and-drop interface. When the page loads, the access code is generated, and placeholders are created for each digit. Users can drop a draggable item into a designated area to initiate the cracking process, which involves guessing each digit from right to left. The application updates the displayed digits in real-time, indicating correct guesses, and simulates a delay for each attempt. Once all digits are guessed correctly, it displays a message indicating whether access is granted or denied.
